[00:09.12] Hey, what did I do?
[00:12.34] Can't believe the fit I just threw
[00:15.78] Stupid (Hey!)
[00:17.74] Wanted the reaction (Hey!)
[00:21.68] (Wanted the reaction)
[00:32.18] 
[00:24.44] I remember the words
[00:27.24] How I said them, so they would hurt
[00:30.79] But then, (Hey!) I regret my actions
[00:35.99] (Hey!) I regret my actions
[00:48.99] 
[00:39.25] If I could press rewind
[00:41.64] Rewind the tape
[00:43.01] Redefine the line
[00:45.13] We make mistakes
[00:46.76] Take it back in time
[00:48.95] Just one day (Hey!) Ay
[00:59.95] 
[00:53.35] So all I need is a Time Machine
[01:01.70] A one way track 'cause
[01:05.36] I'm taking it back, taking it back
[01:09.00] All I want is a DeLorean
[01:16.50] If I could go just like that
[01:19.97] I'll be taking it back, taking it back
[01:38.97] 
[01:28.78] Yeah who's laughing now?
[01:31.47] Didn't think you'd actually go
[01:34.82] Stupid (Hey!)
[01:36.42] Me and all my bitching (Hey!)
[01:40.58] (Me and all my bitching)
[01:52.58] 
[01:43.06] Second thoughts and regrets
[01:46.34] Wanna alt, delete and reset but then (Hey!)
[01:50.96] This ain't science fiction (Hey!)
[01:55.41] (This ain't science fiction)
[02:09.41] 
[01:57.86] If I could press rewind
[02:00.18] Rewind the tape
[02:02.16] Redefine the line
[02:04.45] We make mistakes
[02:05.63] Take it back in time
[02:08.34] Just one day (Hey!) Ay
[02:19.34] 
[02:11.90] So all I need is a Time Machine
[02:20.08] A one way track 'cause
[02:24.15] I'm taking it back, taking it back
[02:27.80] All I want is a DeLorean
[02:35.43] If I could go just like that
[02:38.58] I'll be taking it back, taking it back
[02:57.58] 
[02:43.11] Taking it back, taking it back
[02:46.87] Taking it back, taking it back
[03:01.87] 
[02:55.15] So all I need is a Time Machine
[03:05.36] A one way track 'cause
[03:09.32] I'm taking it back, taking it back
[03:12.85] All I want is a DeLorean
[03:19.93] If I could go just like that
[03:23.52] I'll be taking it back, taking it back
[03:42.52] 
[03:28.25] Taking it back, taking it back
[03:31.50] Oh yeah!
