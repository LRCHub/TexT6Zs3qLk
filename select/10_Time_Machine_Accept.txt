The hands keep on turning, the pendulum just swings
Prisoners upon this rock, flying without wings
Captured in a moment, still the hours chimed
Joining closer as it shifted with the sands of time
Paranoid dimensions, guilt falls into place
Driven by an unseen force, swelling into space
At beyond the rainbow, cross the Milky Way
Passengers without a choice, slowly turning grey
On through the night, shine on forever
Going insane as we ride the time machine
Waiting for no one, relative to none
Answering to not a thing, except the rising sun
Bouncing on this fabric, at the speed of light
Connecting points of futures past, is its only plight
Passengers without a choice, hanging by a string
Spending with a hands of time, flying without wings
